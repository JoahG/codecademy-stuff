This directory contains the source files for the GitHub Pages of my Codecademy stuff.

## Made With Octopress
All the files from [source](../source) are processed by Octopress and the result is then pushed to the `gh-pages` branch to publish the actual pages.

[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is a feature-rich [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) template.

- Theme used: [Classic Light](https://github.com/octopress-themes/classic-light) by Octopress Themes(http://octopressthemes.com/)
- Here’s [how to deploy](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/) an Octopress Blog to GitHub Pages
